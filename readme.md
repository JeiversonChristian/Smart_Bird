# Smart Bird

## An artificial intelligence playing Flappy Bird.
---

## Description
The Artificial Intelligence was made using NEAT - Neural Evolution Augmenting Topology (a neural network that progress each generation). For more informations, read: [NEAT-Python’s documentation](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To understand the config.txt file, access: [Configuration file description](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html).

The code was made in Python, using the "paygame", "on", "random" and "neat" libraries.

## How to run this project

To run this project, we have two options:

1) AI Plays
    * Download de SmartBirdAI.py file and the folders "images" and "config".
    * Install neat: `pip install neat-python`  - version used: 0.92
    * Install pygame: `pip install pygame` - version used: 2.3.0 
    * Run the SmartBirdAI.py file (Visual Stuio Code recommended).
2) You play
    * The same, but using the SmartBird.py file

## AI playing

Here we have an image of the AI playing the game. We have the 2º generation of Smart Birds trying to progress in the game. We also can see the score of the generation.

At the end of game, it shows the best generation and its score.
